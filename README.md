## Creator's resources

Here are some resources that you may find helpful.

### Samples & Example
Our content creator, Frank Boucher, has decided to address the question "How to run an .exe file from Azure Function" on Microsoft Q&A. 
Here are all the pieces of content that Frank provided for the creation of a One Dev Q&A video.

#### Script

The script is the source of thru that provide all the information for us to produce your video. It provides the text that our professional will read to create an audio file.

The script also contains instruction for the video editor to highlight part of the screen when it make sense (ex: highlight line 31 in the code when explanations are provided).

Have a look to [the script used](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/questions-and-answers-sample.docx) in the creation of the video. (It's a Word document.)


#### Screen Capture

Once the script is done it's time to record your screen. Make sure it's in 1980 x 1020. Do not zoom-in or move your mouse cursor to highlight something... This should be part of the script. 

You can talk while recording to help you with the speed. However your voice won't be used in the final recording. Look [this screen capture](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/Screen_only_1080_no-zoom.mp4) an note how the mouse stay still.

##### Still Images (Optional)

Sometime a video recording isn't the best solution to answer. If you think this is your case you can reach out to validate with us, and then use still images.

#### Final Result Video

You can watch the üì∫[final result in this finished video](./asset/sample/QnA%20-%20Execute%20an%20Exe%20in%20Azure_final.mp4). Note how the script provided the instruction to highlight section of the screen, and complement the screen recording.
