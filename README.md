Have you ever searched online for a solution to a tech problem that you have, and wished that you could have easily gotten the answer from a short video instead of having to comb through countless pages?

<b> We feel the same, and YOU can now make a difference.</b>

## Call for Content Creators 

Short sizzle reels or trailers addressing frequently asked questions on Microsoft Q&A played can help our community learn better. There is a new mantra in learning and that's "show, don't tell". 

üëâ We are inviting you to partner with us to create a no-longer than 2 minute content to address a frequently asked question found on any of our Microsoft forums like [Microsoft Q&A](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftQuestionsandAnswers), and [Power Platform Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com).

## Creating your content

Before you start, here's what you need to note. 

1.  Visit [Microsoft Q&A](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftQuestionsandAnswers) or [Microsoft Power Platform Community Forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com)
    - Start by combing through the questions and the tags to find questions that are frequently asked, in the topic that you are passionate about. <br/>
    **New!** We have now improved the program to provide you with the most frequently asked questions based on tags, as well as questions that fellow community have submitted. You can find them the queries in [the discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/discussions)
1. Once you decide on the question to address and answer, it's time to create your video. Provide a screen recording with the requirements below. 
    - Refer to [How to write a quality answer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/support/quality-answer?utm_source=github) for the best practices.
1. Complete [Call for Content form](https://forms.office.com/r/RMXR9TbVbe) to inform us to submit your content.  
<i> Please note that submissions are subjected to Microsoft Q&A's team approval. Creators with shortlisted submissions will be notified via email before content is published on the site.</i>
1. Once your submission is approved, we will work with you to produce the video. We'll take care of production and you can focus on creating great content. 
1. Once video is produced, you will amplify it on Microsoft Q&A and other forums with similar threads and questions. 

## Creator's resources

Here are some resources that you may find helpful.

### Samples & Example
Our content creator, Frank Boucher, has decided to address the question "How to run an .exe file from Azure Function" (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/806260/execute-an-exe-in-azure.html) on Microsoft Q&A. 
Here are all the pieces of content that Frank has provided for the creation of a One Dev Q&A video.

#### Screen Capture
Provide us with a screen recording of how you would address the answer to the question. 
Because we want the videos to look as consistent as possible, you should take note of the following:
1. Make sure it's in the format 1920 x 1080, .mp4 preferred. 
2. Do not zoom-in or move your mouse cursor to highlight something. This should be part of the script. 
3. You can talk while recording to help you with the speed. However, your voice won't be used in the final recording. 

Have a look at [this screen capture](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/Screen_only_1080_no-zoom.mp4) and you may noticed how the cursor stays still.

##### Still Images (Optional)
Sometimes a video recording isn't sufficient to best answer the question. If you think this is your case, you can reach out to validate with us, and then send us your still images along with your video recording. 

[Sample still image](asset/sample/sample-azportal-kudupath.png) also in 1920 x 1080

#### Script (Optional)
We also provide you the option providing us a script along with your video. While we know this may be more labrious but this may also reduce the likelihood of clarifications back and forth that we may eventually have with you. The script also provide you the opportunity to think through your narrative, conceptualising your video. For example, 
1. what should our voice-over professional read to match your recording;
2. what are the the instructions for the video editor to highlight part of the screen when it make sense (example, highlight line 31 in the code when explanations are provided). 

Have a look at [the script used](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/questions-and-answers-sample.docx) in the creation of the video. (It's a Word document.) [Template script](./asset/template/questions-and-answers-template.docx) for your use and to plan out your thought process.

#### Final Result Video

Now that you have seen the script, and the recordings that Frank has provided, you can watch the üì∫finished video [mp4 file](./asset/sample/QnA%20-%20Execute%20an%20Exe%20in%20Azure_final.mp4) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0iheDwm5Ac). You will notice how the script provided the instructions to highlight section of the screen, and complement the screen recording.

### Frequently Asked Questions 
Please check this section regularly.
* <b> How do I know that I would not be answering a question that has been answered?</b>
<br> Approved submissions to the CFC and their respective questions will be displayed in the section "Contributors" below. This information will be provided for at the beginning of every week. Before submitting a CFC, all content creators should check that they do not submit a repeat question. </br>
* <b> Could I produce the content in other languages other than English? </b>
<br> We are currently only accepting content in English; however, we are in the process of creating various platforms to allow hosting of non-English content. To ensure that our content is up-to-date and the latest, the CFC for non-English video take place when the platforms are ready and available.</br>
* <b> What should I do with loading time when I am recording my screen?</b>
<br> When you are creating resources or uploading files, you will need to wait for that process to be completed. This will cause your video recording to be longer than it should (or two minutes). Do not cut the video or speed it up. Our production team will take care of it.
