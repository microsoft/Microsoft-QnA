Have you ever searched online for a solution to a tech problem that you have, and wished that you could have easily gotten the answer from a short video instead having to comb through countless pages?

<b> We feel the same, and YOU can now make a difference.</b>

## Call for Content Creators 

Short sizzle reels or trailers addressing frequently asked questions on Microsoft Q&A played after every show and free airtime can help our community learn.

üëâ We are inviting you to partner with us to create a no-longer than 2 minute content to address a frequently asked question found on [Microsoft Q&A](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftQuestionsandAnswers)

## Creating your content

Before you start, here's what you need to note. 

1.  Visit [Microsoft Q&A](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftQuestionsandAnswers)
    - Start by combing through the questions and the tags to find questions that are frequently asked, in the topic that you are passionate about.
    - Refer to [briefing notes (available soon)](#)
1. Once you decide on the question to address and answer, create your script.
    - Refer to sample script and use the template script found in the [Creator's resources](#creators-resources) below.
    - Refer to [How to write a quality answer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/support/quality-answer?utm_source=github) for the best practices.
1. Provide screen recording that will accompany your script. Follow requirements below.
1. Complete [Call for Content form](https://forms.office.com/r/RMXR9TbVbe) to inform us to submit your content.  
<i> Please note that submissions are subjected to Microsoft Q&A's team approval. Creators with shortlisted submissions will be notified via email before content is published on the site.</i>
1. Once your submission is approved, we will work with you to produce the video. Production will be done on our end. 
1. Once video is produced, you will amplify it on Microsoft Q&A and other forums with similar threads and questions. 

## Creator's resources

Here are some resources that you may find helpful.

### Samples & Example
Our content creator, Frank Boucher, has decided to address the question "How to run an .exe file from Azure Function" (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/806260/execute-an-exe-in-azure.html) on Microsoft Q&A. 
Here are all the pieces of content that Frank provided for the creation of a One Dev Q&A video.

#### Script

The script is the single source of truth that provides all the information for us to produce your video. It provides: 
1. the text that our professional will read to create an audio file, and 
2. the instructions for the video editor to highlight part of the screen when it make sense (example, highlight line 31 in the code when explanations are provided). 

Have a look at [the script used](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/questions-and-answers-sample.docx) in the creation of the video. (It's a Word document.)


#### Screen Capture

Once the script is done, it's time to record your screen. 
Because we want the videos to look as consistent as possible, you should take note of the following:
1. Make sure it's in the format 1980 x 1020, .mp4 preferred. 
2. Do not zoom-in or move your mouse cursor to highlight something. This should be part of the script. 
3. You can talk while recording to help you with the speed. However, your voice won't be used in the final recording. 

Have a look at [this screen capture](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-QnA/raw/main/asset/sample/Screen_only_1080_no-zoom.mp4) and you may noticed how the cursor stays still.

##### Still Images (Optional)
Sometimes a video recording isn't the best solution to answer. If you think this is your case you can reach out to validate with us, and then send us your still images along with your video recording.

#### Final Result Video

Now that you have seen the script, and the recordings that Frank has provided, you can watch the üì∫[finished video](./asset/sample/QnA%20-%20Execute%20an%20Exe%20in%20Azure_final.mp4). Notice how the script provided the instructions to highlight section of the screen, and complement the screen recording.
